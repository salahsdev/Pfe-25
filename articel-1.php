Gladiators battled each other as well wild animals in the Colosseum's arena, which is considered one of the seven modern wonders of the world. In the giant 'ruins' of the Colosseum, you can visit the stands, the arena and the underground areas of this largest Roman amphitheatre.</p>

                    <p>The most famous fountain in the capital of Italy and perhaps even the world must be the 'Fontana di Trevi', or Trevi Fountain. This baroque fountain, located on the Piazza di Trevi, was built in the 18th century and a must see of the list of <strong>best things to do in Rome</strong>. The landmark and monument displays the god of the sea Neptune on his chariot.</p>

                    <p>One of the best maintained buildings from Roman times is the Pantheon. What function the building had in those days is still not clear, but the Pantheon was given to the pope by emperor Hadrian in 608. The current church has several unique funerary monuments (painter Raphael and a few Italian kings), as well as a remarkably large and open dome (oculus). Since a while you need to buy tickets to visit the Roman Pantheon.</p>

                    <p>Start with the heart of it all: St. Peter’s Basilica—a towering symbol of the Catholic Church and resting place of Saint Peter himself. This vast and sacred space houses wonders like Michelangelo’s Pietà and Bernini’s magnificent baldachin. Beneath, you’ll find the crypts with over 140 papal tombs. It’s one of the most awe-inspiring sites in the world—just be sure to book in advance, or prepare for a long wait.</p>

                    <p>The basilica, dedicated to pope Clement I, is not one of the most impressive churches of Roma at a first glance of its interior. What makes this Basilica of San Clemente special is that multiple church buildings were built on top of each other over the centuries. During your visit, you will have the opportunity to get to know the history of the church through excavations of a 4th-century church, a secret church from the 1st century and Roman foundations.</p>

                    <h3>1.Pasta alla Carbonara</h3>
                    <p>The undisputed king of Roman cuisine, carbonara is more than a dish—it's a ritual. Beloved by locals with near-religious fervor, this simple yet bold classic is a far cry from French culinary pomp. Crisped guanciale releases its rich fat, while egg yolks, pecorino, and black pepper are whisked into a creamy, peppery sauce. No cream. No nonsense. Just pure Roman soul on a plate.</p>

                    <p>The third crown jewel of Roman pasta, bucatini all’Amatriciana is a fiery ode to tomato lovers. Built on slow-cooked tomatoes, crisp guanciale, a splash of white wine, a pinch of chili, and shavings of pecorino, it’s rustic brilliance in a bowl—cucina povera with soul. Born in the hills of Lazio, shepherds first made it in bianco, before tomatoes ever touched Italian soil. Pecorino from their sheep, cured pork that traveled well—this dish carries centuries in each bite.</p>

                    <p>Romans may love their pasta, but greens are never far from the table. The favorite? Cicoria ripassata—wild dandelion greens sautéed with garlic, chili, and plenty of olive oil. Bitter, bold, and packed with flavor, it’s a rustic classic still loved by Italian families on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
